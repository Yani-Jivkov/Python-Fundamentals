# Programming Fundamentals with Python - Homework Repository

Welcome to my repository for the "Programming Fundamentals with Python" course homework! This repository serves as a personal archive of the coding assignments I've completed throughout the course. Each homework set corresponds to a specific week and covers a range of topics introduced in the "Programming Fundamentals with Python" course.

# Repository Structure

The repository is organized by homework sets, each named HomeworkN, where N represents the week number. Inside each homework set, you'll find Python scripts numbered sequentially. These scripts are solutions to the weekly programming assignments and collectively cover a wide range of fundamental programming concepts in Python.
