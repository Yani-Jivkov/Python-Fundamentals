# Programming Fundamentals with Python - Homework Repository

Welcome to my repository for the "Programming Fundamentals with Python" course homework! This repository serves as a personal archive of the coding assignments I've completed throughout the course. Each homework set corresponds to a specific week and covers a range of topics introduced in the "Programming Fundamentals with Python" course.

# Repository Structure

The repository is organized by homework sets, each named HomeworkN, where N represents the week number. Inside each homework set, you'll find Python scripts numbered sequentially. These scripts are solutions to the weekly programming assignments and collectively cover a wide range of fundamental programming concepts in Python.

# Example Structure:

Homework1/: Introduction to Python and basic concepts.
Homework2/: Control structures and loops.
Homework3/: Functions and modules.
Homework4/: Lists and dictionaries.
Homework5/: Object-oriented programming basics.
Projects/: Larger projects that apply concepts learned throughout the course.
How to Use This Repository
To explore the homework assignments, navigate through the HomeworkN folders. Each Python script within these folders is named in a sequential order, indicating the progression of assignments. To run any script, ensure you have Python installed on your machine, navigate to the script's directory in your terminal, and execute:
